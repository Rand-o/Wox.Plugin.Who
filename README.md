# Wox.Plugin.Who
Plugin to get hostname or IP based on input (hostname/IP).

Requires Python modules netaddr and pyperclip.

This is a plugin I created for my everyday work as a Network Engineer.
This allows me to quickly do a DNS lookup and copy to the clipboard without opening a terminal / cmd prompt.
Hitting enter on the result will copy it to your clipboard.
